Let's compare the average heights of 19 students based on gender.

The data is contained in the Sashelp.Class dataset.

To use PROC TTEST for summary statistics, the statistics must be in a SAS dataset that contains a character variable called _STAT_ with the values ​​'N', 'MEAN' and 'STD'. 

As we are interested in a two-sample test, the data must also contain a grouping variable. Use “sex” as the grouping variable, call PROC MEANS to write summary statistics to a dataset and print a subset of the statistics. 

Then use PROC TTEST to perform the following hypothesis test: 

Null Hypothesis (H0) - Average heights are the same for both groups (male and female)

Alternative Hypothesis (H1) - Average heights are not the same for both the groups (male and female) 

What are your conclusions? 

Should we or shouldn't we reject H0?
