Let's use the bweight dataset that is available in the SASHLP library

Exercise 1 -Using PROCSQL, calculate the average weight of all children, the average weight of boys (column boy = 1) and the average weight of girls (column boy = 0).

Exercise 2 -Using PROCSQL, create a random sample equivalent to 10% of the original dataset. Tip: use the ranuni() function to generate random values ​​used to select the data.

Exercise 3 -Using PROCSQL, create a random sample equivalent to 5000 records from the original dataset. Tip: use the ranuni() function to generate random values ​​used to select the data.

Exercise 4 -Using PROC surveyselect, create two samples with the same criteria as exercises 2 and 3. Tip: use the SRS (Simple Random Sampling) method of procsurveyselect.

Exercise 5 -Using SQL PROC, we will create a stratified sample. First, create two samples, with 2500 records each. 
The first sample must contain only male children and the second only female children. Then join the two samples together creating the final sample.
